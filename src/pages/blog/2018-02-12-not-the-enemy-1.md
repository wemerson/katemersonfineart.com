I have been very concerned with the sharp right turn our country has taken and have been looking for a way to express that concern through art. I wanted to do that in a positive way, showing the beauty of diversity instead of the ugliness of racism, misogyny, nationalism, homophobia and so forth. I hit upon the idea of doing a series of portraits called "Not the Enemy". Here are the first five paintings in the series.
