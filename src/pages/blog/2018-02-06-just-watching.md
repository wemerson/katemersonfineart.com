Well, hello out there! 

This is my first blog entry on my new, improved website. 

There’s a lot happening in my artistic life.  I’ve joined Daily Paintworks, at dailypaintworks.com and I’ve also joined Leslie Saeta’s February 30 in 30 challenge over at lesliesaetafineart.com.

Daily Paintworks is a fabulous site, run by generous owners David and Carol Marine, dedicated to helping painters get their work out there. They provide a gallery for each individual artist, and lots of ways to link up, buy and sell and keep track of art works, for a minimal monthly fee and a very small commission on sold works.  Carol creates lovely little jewels of paintings and has also written a very informative book called Daily Painting.

Leslie Saeta is a wonderful artist in her own right and also hosts an art marketing and artist interview weekly podcast called “Artists Helping Artists”, which is full of helpful and inspiring information. For a while now, she has also been hosting twice yearly “30 paintings in 30 days” painting challenges.  Anyone can join and it’s free. 

I’m also part of a figure drawing group that has been meeting once a week for about fifteen years.  We do one long, three hour pose every week.

So, here are my first three offerings for both Daily Paintworks and the 30 in 30 challenge, along with this week’s figure drawing.
