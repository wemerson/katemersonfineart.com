I'm experimenting with using transparent paints and a mostly monochromatic palette, wiping away the lights instead of using white or other opaque colors. This is closely akin to drawing, my first love, and a lovely way to explore edges and transitions between values. It could be used as an underpainting for a full color rendition, but I'm enjoying the effect as it is, with the idea of selectively adding color as I investigate this approach.
